This is a React with Flux template I wrote with signup, login, and GET /contacts routes that are authenticated with passport and JWT.
I have a matching repository which contains the backend API here: [SignupAndLoginTemplate](https://github.com/alexbuchan/SignupAndLoginTemplate)

This project is meant to help me learn how to write a React application with Flux, which I can then turn into real applications.
